== Initialization ==
User -> AS : enterPinCode(P)
activate AS
AS -> AS : valid(P)
AS --> User : State: Active

== Sensor Data Retrieval ==
loop Every 60 ms [Asynchronous]
    AS -> DR : updateSensors()
    activate DR
    DR -> S : sampleData()
    activate S
    S --> DR : v(Si)
    deactivate S
    DR --> AS : sensorData
    deactivate DR
end

== Camera Data Retrieval ==
loop Every 120 ms [Asynchronous]
    AS -> DR : updateCamera()
    activate DR
    DR -> C : sampleData()
    activate C
    C --> DR : v(C)
    deactivate C
    DR --> AS : cameraData
    deactivate DR
end

== Data Analysis and Intrusion Check ==
AS -> AM : analyze(sensorData, cameraData)
activate AM
AM -> AM : checkIntrusion(sensorData, cameraData)
AM --> AS : Event
deactivate AM

== Event Handling ==
alt If Intrusion Detected
    AS -> AS : handle_event(Intrusion)
    AS --> User : Alarm ON
    AS -> AS : State: Alarmed
else No Intrusion
    AS -> AS : reset()
end

== Alarm Handling ==
alt Valid Pin Entered
    User -> AS : enterPinCode(P)
    AS -> AS : valid(P)
    AS --> User : State: Active
else 10s Elapsed
    AS -> SC : advanceTime(10000)
    SC --> AS
    AS -> AS : reset()
    AS --> User : State: Active
end
